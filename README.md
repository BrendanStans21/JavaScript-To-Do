 # JavaScript-To-Do
 # Author: Brendan Stansfield
 # Date Created: 6/13/22

The purpose of this project is to practice and learn JavaScript.  While the main focus is on JavaScript, my goal to to learn frontend development as a whole, so I will try and write clean HTML and CSS and make the site as responsive and aethetically pleasing as I can.  Any suggestions on style would be greatly appreciated.

The program will be a very simple to do list website.  The program will contoin one text box where the user can enter a new task as well as two buttons, one to save the task and one to clear the text box.  

If save is hit, the button will run some JavaScript code that will add the task as a new list item in an unordered list.  The task will be displayed below the text entry box. 

Each task will also have two buttons beside it, one will allow the user to delete the task if they want to remove a completed task or they made a mistake, and one will allow the user to mark the task as done.  Marking the task as done will change the task to green and the text will have a line through it.  

The final feature will be a Clear Task List button that will delete all tasks currently in the list, allowing the user to start over.

Because the focus is on JavaScript, there will be no backend database to manage logins and task data or use of cookies to store the list if the user leaves the site and comes back.  I may come back in the future and implement such features once I have mastered JavaScript and Frontend development and move to learn about backend development.
